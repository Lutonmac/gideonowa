        <h2>Reality of universe</h2>
        <p>The universe is a cruel, uncaring void. The key to being happy isn't a search for meaning. It's to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually, you'll be dead.</p>
        <p>This should teach you not to break an arm while jerking yourself off.</p>
        <p>We should think about this; Why would a Pop-Tart want to live inside a toaster? I mean, that would be like the scariest place for them to live. You know? 'Cause human beings, we have no idea what goes on in there at night.</p>
