    <h1>Cascading the universe</h1>
    <aside>
        <h2>Reality of universe</h2>
        <p>The universe is a cruel, uncaring void. The key to being happy isn't a search for meaning. It's to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually, you'll be dead.</p>
        <p>This should teach you not to break an arm while jerking yourself off.</p>
        <p>We should think about this; Why would a Pop-Tart want to live inside a toaster? I mean, that would be like the scariest place for them to live. You know? 'Cause human beings, we have no idea what goes on in there at night.</p>
    </aside>
    <section>
        <h2>Certainty and uncertainty</h2>
        <p>We're just lucky to have each other, you know? Lucky that we were born in the same reality, lucky that our paths crossed.</p>
        <p>"Don't be not the nicest guy in the universe, but be the smartest, being nice is something stupid people do to hedge their bets."</p>
        <p>This is why you shouldn't be scared on having your 2cent about certain topic; just as when you think about it, Weddings are basically funerals with cake. It is an occurrence that has an uncertain outcome</p>
        <p>So if you look at it this way, the worst part about inventing teleportation? Suddenly, you're able to travel the whole galaxy, and the first thing you learn is, you're the last guy to invent teleportation.</p>
        <p>And this suddenly makes you uncertain about everything about life because at the end death is still the only constant thing; immortality is myth.</p>
